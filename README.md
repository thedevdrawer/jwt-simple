# PHP JSON Web Token without Firebase JWT
Learn how to create your own JSON web tokens without Firebase JWT or any other JWT frameworks. In this tutorial, we will learn how to create your own JWT class in PHP.

JWT or JSON Web Tokens is is a digitally signed, trusted connection between two services (usually an API and a webserver). With JWT, you can allow access to external sources with the knowledge that the request is valid and made intentionally. This can help you develop your own API as laid out in my 33rd video called "Add Security and JWT Tokenization to Your PHP REST API, Part 6 - #33". You can find that here: [https://youtu.be/t43DRY3Ee9w](https://youtu.be/t43DRY3Ee9w)

In this tutorial, we will be building our own JWT generator instead of using a framework like Firebase JWT (as we did in the other video). You can easily create your own JWT authentication and run it against your API to validate users or information.  Without using a framework, we open our code a bit to allow us to customize it more as we see fit.

This type of project is for smaller APIs, but should get you through most of what you would need if developing something in-house or just to learn how they work.
